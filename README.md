# deliveroo-clone

This is a React Native project, in which I have created a clone food delivery application (Deliveroo). This application is based on React Native as well as Tailwind CSS for styling. Moreover the data is being imported from Sanity, and it uses Redux for the state.

The initial commit is just a demo version, and currently it does not include payments.
